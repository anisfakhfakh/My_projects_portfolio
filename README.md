# Project: Editing Facial emotion using GANs(Active)
* Build a system that can change facial expression (smiling face)
* Using StyleGANs

---
# Project: Articles summarizer(Active)
* Build a text summarizer system
* Using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques applied in NLP
* Use One-text summarization(each text in the corpus has its own summarization)

---

# [Notebook: Fraud detection of transactions](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh/Fraud-detection-of-transactions) 
* A starter notebook for a hackathon hosted by Zindi
* Using Data analysis and prediction to predict whether a transaction is fraudent or not 

---

# Project: Real-time object detection using different approaches(Active)
* Build Object detection (+Instance sengmentation) system 
* Using popular methods such as YOLO, R-CNNs, etc.

---

# Project: Dogs images Generation with GANs
* Build a Generative model generating random dogs images
* Inspired by the [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/generative-dog-images/overview) 

Through 6-7 hours of train on kaggle, the model was able to produce these dogs images. The longer the train, the better and more realistic the images seem.

# Project(Internship): Topic modelling for Financial Artciles
* Build a Topic modelling system to assign topics to financial articles 
* Using Guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation to assign topics

I was able to get the output results of a few articles for 4 topic clusters by getting the percentage of significance

# [Project: Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh/Twitter-sentiment-analysis) 
* Build a model capable of predicting the sentiment of a tweet from a labeled dataset
* Using Machine learning NLP techniques
* Predict wsether a tweet sentiment is positive or negative

I was able to get the model to predict the sentiments of tweets after traing the data, with an accuracy of 80% using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine.
This is a screenshot comparing

# [Project: Chess game random walk](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh/Chess_game-random_walk) 
* A Random walk theory real life example
* Implement a real life application of random walk using Chess to illustrate it
* Simulating the random walk of a Knight piece according to the maximaum number of iterations
* Observing the evolution of successful walks
* Adding advanced conditions

Below are few screenshots I was able to get from the project:
